My name is **Jianhui** and I'm a researcher at the [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/). I use experimental methods and classical theories to study quantum phenomena in condensed matter, with a current focus on novel spin liquid physics.

This site is a slow assembly of interesting parts during my research.
