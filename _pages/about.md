# About
============================================

<img align="right" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57921137?v=4" style="margin: 0px 10px;width:150px;border-radius:75%;" />
My name is **Jianhui** and I'm a researcher at the [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/). Before this, I worked as a Research Scientist in the Department of Methods for Characterization of Transport Phenomena in Energy Materials and Quantum Phenomena in Novel Materials of [Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/). I have obtained my Ph.D degree in condensed matter physics in Department of Physics of [
Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), Germany.

# Research Interests
============================================

My interest is in quantum phenomena in novel materials, especially strongly correlated transition-metal and rare-earth compounds. In this class of materials, there exists competition between spin-orbital coupling, crystal electric field, exchange interactions. Quantum fluctuations due to low dimensionality, small spin, or frustration are often important and induces enormous emergent phenomena, e.g. quantum spin liquid, order by disorder and topological phases, which ultimately control the physical properties of the material.

<!---I use experimental methods and classical theories to study quantum phenomena in condensed matter, with a current focus on novel spin liquid physics.-->
